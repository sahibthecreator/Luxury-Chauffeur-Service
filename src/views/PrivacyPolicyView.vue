                <b>In Short</b>: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid
                legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws,
                to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or
                to fulfil our legitimate business interests.
                <br><br>
                The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we

                <li>
                    Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with

                    or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
                    involved.
                </li>
                <li>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital
                    interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the
                    safety of any person.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="my">4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h5>
            <p><b>In Short</b>: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following
                third parties.

                <li>Business Partners. We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain
                    products, services, or promotions.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="my">5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
            <p><b>In Short</b>: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy
                notice unless otherwise required by law.
                <br><br>
                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
                privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
                or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information
                for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
                <br><br>
                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
                or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
                has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
                from any further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>

            <h5 class="my">6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h5>
            <p><b>In Short</b>: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical
                security measures.
                <br><br>
                We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to
                protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
                secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can
                be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
                unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
                modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
                personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
                within a secure environment.
            </p>
            <h5 class="my">7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h5>
            <p><b>In Short</b>: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
                <br><br>
                We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services,
                you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
                such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18
                years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
                delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
                age 18, please contact us at info@lordconcierge.com.

                If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information,
                you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection
                authority.
                <br><br>
                If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.
                <br><br>
                Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have
                the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us
                by using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#12">'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT

                <br><br>
                However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor,
                will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing
                grounds other than consent.
                <br><br>
                Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing and
                promotional communications at any time by replying 'STOP' or 'UNSUBSCRIBE' to the Email messages that we

                    THIS NOTICE?'</a>
                below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for
                example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your
                account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
            </p>

                Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from
                our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot

                requirements.

            </p>
            <h5 class="my">9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h5>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT')
                feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
                browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising
                and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
                or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
                for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
                a revised version of this privacy notice.
            </p>
